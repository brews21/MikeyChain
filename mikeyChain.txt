Block chain project


looking into Block chain

-- whats is this/ what is it doing -- "ECDSASig"
-- look in to the minning part
    -- still not sure why it looks for a substring to confirm/ state the block has been mined
    -- or why it createsa substring of "0" and replaces the section
-- look at the "Merkle Root" adn "Elliptic-Curve cryptography" in relation to block chain and maths etc...
-- transactions input/ output process

-- what are miners checking/ solving



General look at

-- Java 101 -- tip and tricks
    -- hash maps

-- look at doing this in C++ and C#
